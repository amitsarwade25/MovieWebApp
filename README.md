In addition to displaying trending movies, the app also features a search bar that allows users to search for any movie by title. Upon entering a search query, the app displays relevant results, presenting movie posters that match the search terms.

Interactive Hover Feature
To make the experience more interactive, the app includes a hover feature on each movie poster. When users hover over a movie poster, a short synopsis of the movie appears. This provides a quick summary of the plot, allowing users to get a feel for the movie without needing to navigate to another page.

This feature enhances the user experience by making the information accessible directly from the homepage, minimizing the number of clicks and ensuring a seamless browsingÂ experience.
